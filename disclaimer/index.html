                contrary local, state, or federal data protection regulations to the fullest extent permitted by law.
                You acknowledge and agree that UWDF has no obligation to delete, anonymize, restrict, limit, or cease

                You consent to such monitoring regardless of whether you are actively engaged with UWDF services, have
                minimized the interface, or are operating in private or incognito modes.

                use of UWDF’s products or services, at any time and for any reason, in its sole and absolute discretion.
                UWDF may charge such Fees automatically to any payment method associated with your account, without
                additional notice, and you agree to remain fully responsible for all Fees incurred, regardless of
                whether you were aware of the changes at the time they were implemented.
            </p>
            <p>
                You acknowledge and agree that you have no reasonable expectation of privacy in connection with your use

                UWDF services, with or without your knowledge or consent, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
                Such activities may occur even when you believe your data is encrypted, secured, hidden, private, or
                otherwise shielded.
            </p>
            <p>
                UWDF reserves the unrestricted right, in its sole and unreviewable discretion, to refuse, restrict,
                suspend, or terminate access to any UWDF product or service to any individual or entity at any time, for
                any reason or for no reason whatsoever, including but not limited to personal preference, administrative
                convenience, internal policy, or subjective determinations made by UWDF employees, contractors,
                algorithms, or automated decision systems.
                UWDF shall have no obligation to explain, justify, or document the basis for such refusals, and shall
                bear no liability for any resulting damages or consequences.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree that the terms, conditions, structure, content, and existence of this Agreement, including any
                amendments or communications related thereto, constitute confidential information belonging exclusively
                to UWDF.
                You may not disclose, disseminate, reproduce, publish, share, or otherwise make available any portion of
                this Agreement to any third party without the prior written consent of UWDF, except where disclosure is
                explicitly required by law and you provide UWDF with prompt written notice of such requirement.
                UWDF reserves the right to take any lawful action to enforce this confidentiality obligation.
            </p>
            <p>
                UWDF reserves the right, in its sole and absolute discretion, to suspend, limit, restrict, deactivate,
                or permanently terminate your access to any UWDF product, account, or service at any time, for any
                reason or for no reason, without prior notice, without explanation, and without liability of any kind.
                Upon such termination, UWDF may immediately delete, disable, or deny access to any content, materials,
                or data associated with your account, with no obligation to provide copies, backups, or restoration,
                except where otherwise required by law.
                You acknowledge that UWDF shall not be liable for any losses, damages, or harms—direct or
                indirect—arising from or related to such termination.
            </p>
            <p>
                UWDF may amend, revise, supplement, or entirely replace this Agreement at any time, for any reason, in
                its sole and absolute discretion, by posting an updated version through any UWDF-controlled channel.
                You agree that your continued access to or use of UWDF’s products or services following any such
                modification constitutes your binding acceptance of the revised Agreement, irrespective of whether you
                have reviewed the updated terms.
                UWDF is not required to provide direct notice of modifications.</p>
            <p>
                To the fullest extent permitted by law, you knowingly, voluntarily, and irrevocably waive any right to a
                trial by jury in any action, proceeding, or counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement or
                your use of UWDF’s products or services.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree that any ambiguity, uncertainty, or dispute regarding the interpretation, meaning, or scope of
                any provision within this Agreement shall be resolved exclusively by UWDF, which shall retain the sole
                and absolute authority to interpret, clarify, and determine the intent of all terms herein.
            </p>
            <p>
                If any provision of this Agreement is determined to be invalid, unenforceable, or void, such provision
                shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the remaining provisions shall continue in full
                force and effect.
                UWDF’s failure to enforce any provision shall not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other
                rights under this Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
                UWDF may assign, transfer, delegate, sublicense, or otherwise convey its rights and obligations under
                this Agreement to any third party, successor entity, affiliate, or acquirer, with or without notice to
                you.
                You may not assign or transfer any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written
                consent of UWDF, and any attempted assignment by you shall be null and void.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on certain types of liability. In such cases, UWDF’s
                liability shall be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law. If any portion of this Agreement is
                found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall continue in full force to the maximum extent
                permitted by law.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree that you shall not initiate, join, assist, fund, or participate in any lawsuit, claim,
                dispute, arbitration, administrative action, grievance, or legal proceeding of any kind—whether
                individual or collective—against UWDF’s parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, divisions, successors,
                assigns, contractors, licensors, officers, employees, agents, undisclosed partners, entities yet to be
                formed, or any person or organization acting on behalf of UWDF (“Protected Parties”).
                This prohibition applies to known and unknown entities, existing now or created in the future, whether
                or not you have direct contact with such entities, and whether or not you learn of their connection to
                UWDF.
                You expressly waive any right to assert claims arising from or relating to such entities, including
                claims based on vicarious liability, joint or several liability, partnership, agency, conspiracy, or any
                similar legal theory.
            </p>
            <p>
                You agree to provide and maintain accurate, current, and complete contact information—including but not
                limited to your legal name, mailing address, telephone number, email address, billing information, and
                any other identifiers requested by UWDF.
                Failure to maintain such information, failure to update such information promptly upon change, provision
                of inaccurate or incomplete information, or failure to respond to UWDF’s attempts to verify such
                information shall constitute a material breach of this Agreement.
                UWDF may, in its sole discretion, suspend, restrict, or terminate your access to any product or service
                until accurate information is provided, or permanently, without liability of any kind.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following sections shall survive termination, expiration, or discontinuation of your relationship
                with UWDF for any reason:
                Liability Disclaimers; Indemnification; Data Exploitation; Governing Law; Arbitration; Class-Action
                Waiver; Jury Trial Waiver; Assignment; Survival; Interpretation; and any other provision which, by its
                nature or intent, is reasonably expected to survive.

                BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS-ACTION WAIVER

            <p>
                By accessing or using any products, services, or materials provided by UWDF, you agree to the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to your use of UWDF’s products, services,
                or information—including disputes regarding the validity, enforceability, or scope of this arbitration
                clause—shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court,
                administered by an arbitation provider selected solely by UWDF.
            </p>
            <p>
                Arbitration shall occur in a location designated by UWDF, which may include Delaware, Texas, or any
                other venue deemed convenient for UWDF..
            </p>
            <p>
                You hereby irrevocably waive any right to participate in or initiate any class, collective,
                representative, group, or consolidated action against UWDF or its affiliates.
                All claims must be brought on an individual basis only, and you agree not to serve as a class
                representative, class member, or plaintiff in any such proceeding.
            </p>
            <p>
                This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware,f
                unless UWDF designates another governing designation, without regard to the chosen state's
                conflict-of-law principles.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may opt out of this arbitration agreement only by sending (i) written notice to UWDF within 30 days
                of first use, and (ii) a certified cashier’s check in an administrative amount established by UWDF (not
                less than $10,000) to cover processing costs, unless mutual agreement among both parties exists for an
                alternative way.</p>
            <p>
                User acknowledges that UWDF may update this Agreement at any time by posting an amended version, and
                continued use constitutes acceptance.</p>
