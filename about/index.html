          <h3>The Mission at U.W.D.F</h3>
          <p>Uncle Wong's Dollar Factory is committed to creating a better world for all, especially for people who will
            give us money. We wish to bring, um, <em>quality</em> products to customers. We are steadfastly devoted to
            shaping a better world for all—particularly for those generous individuals who choose to contribute to our
            financial well-being, whether voluntarily or through the subtle persuasion of our “loyalty billing
            adjustments.” We believe that commerce thrives on trust, efficiency, and the occasional clerical oversight
            that <em>accidentally</em> routes customer refunds into our innovation fund. These minor discrepancies,
            which we assure you are absolutely standard in any enterprise, allow us to funnel resources into bold
            initiatives that strengthen local economies, develop new product lines, and help us maintain the comforting
            illusion of corporate responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            In our ongoing commitment to providing “quality products” (a phrase we repeat often enough that it has
            become almost true), we continually refine our processes to ensure our products meet the highest. From
            sourcing materials through what we like to call “accelerated approval channels,” to streamlining
            manufacturing by side-stepping regulations and "worker's rights," we take great pride in our ability to
            deliver efficiently. Even the occasional mislabeled chemical or worker "accident" is, in our view, simply
            evidence that U.W.D.F is more adaptable and better than the competition. After all, progress demands
            boldness, and we definitely deliver on "bold".
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is founded in the belief that a better world is built through improvements in efficiency,
            selective transparency, and confidence that most customers do not read past the first paragraph, or even
            sentence, of a mission statement. By aligning our goals with the needs of our customers (especially the rich
            portion), we aim to cultivate trust, inspire loyalty, and maintain the kind of operational flexibility that
            lets us classify certain “experimental distribution techniques” as community outreach. Through this
            harmonious blend of ambition, efficiency, and carefully phrased legal disclaimers, Uncle Wong’s Dollar
            Factory endeavors to leave a positive mark on society, ideally one that does not result in court hearings.

      <div class="collapse" id="section2">
        <div class="p-3 border-top">
          <p>UWDF traces its earliest lineage to a figure active in the mid-seventeenth century, during the
            consolidation period of the Qing dynasty in present-day Guangzhou, near Hong Kong. Wong Shifu, meaning
            Master Wong, was a textile broker operating along emerging commercial corridors that granted agrarian
            districts with the ability to sell professionally made food. His practice showed pragmatic willingness to
            integrate artisanal knowledge with evolving market demands, being the first to adapt to emerging technology.
            Over time, his dynastic company became a leading teacher of farm-to-table mechanics in China. </p>
          <p>
            <img src="../img/workers/16UntitledFinal.jpg">
          </p>
          <p>The subsequent generation kept his vision intact, and expanded on his company. As political and economic
            conditions shifted, the descendants diversified into materials sale. Continuity rested less on hereditary
            authority and more on the codified operating discipline derived from the original merchant’s frameworks.
            This provided institutional memory that could scale beyond local markets.</p>
          <p>
            <img src="../img/workers/18UntitledFinal.jpg">
          </p>
          <img src="../img/workers/17UntitledFinal.jpg">
          </p>
          <p>The leaders of the organization re-organized it into a more modern form that one would see today. Their
            view of foreign trade, however, conflicted with the Emperor's, and the company sided with the British in the
            Opium Wars. The resulting damage in the aftermath meant they were all done away with, except for one: Wong
            Zhi Mo. He shrunk the company, ushering in the modern era.</p>
          </p>
          <p>Rebuilding the company was difficult with strictly Communist China and the World Wars. By siding with the
            Japanese, the company was again nearly destroyed. Wong Peng, the great-great grandson of Wong Zhi Mo,
            finally, after the hyper-restraining Communism of China was reformed, could build back.</p>

            <img src="../img/workers/10final.jpg">
          </p>
          <p>We have picked up where the Wong family left off, and, with their ongoing support and collaboration, begun
            rebuilding to what once was.</p>
